These scripts contain the simulation model described in: Couce, A.; Guelfo, J.R. and Blazquez J.(2013). 'Mutational Spectrum Drives the Rise of Mutator Bacteria'. PLoS Genetics 9, e1003167. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003167
From the user's point of view, simulations are run by executing the master script "main.R", which defines parameters, creates required objects and calls the script "serial_culture.R" to simulate serial culture experiments.
